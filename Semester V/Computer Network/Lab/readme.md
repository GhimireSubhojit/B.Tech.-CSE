# List of Experiments

1. Write a Client-Server socket program to implement “TCP client server” architecture. (Description: Retrieve information (any text or system info) from TCP server to TCP client.)

2. Write a Client-Server socket program to implement “TCP chat server”. (Description: Two client systems connected to one central server for connection establishment, communication / chat have to be done in client machines.)

3. Write an “Echo Client” and “Echo Server” using UDP to estimate the round trip Time from client to the server. The server should be such that it can accept multiple connections at any given time. (Description: Multiple clients connected at the same time to one server for connection establishment, server has to listen to all the clients, use I/O monitoring calls if
required.)

4. Write an “Echo Client” and “Echo Server” using UDP to estimate the round trip Time from client to the server. The server should be such that it can accept multiple connections at any given time. (Description: Multiple clients connected at the same time to one server for connection establishment, server has to listen to all the clients, use I/O monitoring calls if required.)

5. Write a program for “Connectionless Iterative Service” in which the server finds the factorial of a number sent by the client and sends it back.

6. Write a Client-Server socket program to implement “FTP server” using UDP connection. (Description: The file.txt may be there on the server side with some text; on the client request, the server has to send the text file file.txt and corresponding text has to print on client terminal.)

7. Write a program for “Remote Command Execution” using sockets. (Description: The client sends command(s) and data parameters (if required) to the server. The server will execute the command and send back the result to the client. Execute 3 commands.)

8. Write a program to implement “Web Server”. (Description: The Client will be requesting a web page to be accessed which resides at the Server side.)

EXAM SET 4: Write a program for connection-oriented service in which the server reverses the string sent by the client and sends it back.
