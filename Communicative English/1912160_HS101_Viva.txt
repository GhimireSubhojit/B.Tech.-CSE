The first thing I would like to point out is the fact that being a foreign student, I, along with other foreign students, am still in NIT Guest House. So,  the thought of not being with our parents for so long, while everyone is at their home, is, I must say, a little grim. Also, we are kept under survellience for our own saftey, so there are limited things we can do. As for myself, this lockdown has not been full of stories to tell. All I do is watch movies, play games and sometimes read a book or two. We however have an edge over others in terms of stretching our legs, as we are allowed to roam nearby our guest house for some fresh air and light exercise, which I believe few others at their home struggle with.

Apart from the fact that we are not at our home, I would say that this pandemic has not been so terrifying for me as it has been for people worldwide. We are kept under protection. We have been provided with what we need. Overall, it's not so bad, but I sure would like to see things get back to normal again.
