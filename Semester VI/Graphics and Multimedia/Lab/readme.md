# EXPERIMENT LIST

1. Using OpenGL Primitives display a rectangular window placed it in suitable position and draw a rectangle inside the window having red edges.  

2. Implementation of DDA line drawing algorithm. “The program should take input of the initial end‐point and the final end‐point. Divide the coordinate axes into four quadrants and draw the line. Show that your program works for [m>0, m=0 and m<0]”.  

3. Implementation of Bresenham’s Line drawing algorithm. “The program should take input of the initial end‐point and the final end‐point, and verify whether the drawn line is smooth one or not. The program should be generic so that it works for integer values. Check for the slop of the line (i.e. m>0, m=0 and m<0)”.  

4. Implement a triangle and perform the following 2D transformation over the triangle:
	a. Translation
	b. Scaling
	c. Shearing
	d. Reflection and
	e. Rotation
The program should be menu driven allowing the user to choose any of the transformation. Divide the coordinate axes; display the original object and the transformed object in different colour or different fil patterns.  

5. Given a square object with coordinate points A (0, 3), B (3, 3), C (3, 0), D (0, 0) and perform
	a. Scaling with parameter 2 towards X axis and 3 towards Y axis  
	b. Translation with distance 1 towards X axis and 5 towards Y axis  
	c. Reflection on the X axis  
	d. Shear parameter 3 on X axis and 4 on Y axis  
	e. Rotation 90 degrees anticlockwise  

6. Given a square object with coordinate points A (0, 3), B (3, 3), C (3, 0), D (0, 0) and perform
	a. Scaling with parameter 2 towards X axis and 3 towards Y axis  
	b. Translation with distance 1 towards X axis and 5 towards Y axis  
	c. Reflection on the X axis  
	d. Shear parameter 3 on X axis and 4 on Y axis  
	e. Rotation 90 degrees anticlockwise  

7. Rotation of a rectangle based on pivot points (20, 30).
	a. Translate object to origin from its original position as shown in fig (b).  
	b. Rotate the object about the origin as shown in fig (c).  
	c. Translate the object to its original position from origin. It is called as reverse translation as shown in fig (d).  

8. To consider two black and white images and convert to colour images using tools provided in Gimp Software.  

9. To perform at least 5 image enhancement techniques on two images using tools provided in Gimp Software.  

10. Perform Translation and Scaling Transformations on a 3‐D object.  

11. To create i. Bouncing ball and ii. facial expresison animation using tools provided in Synfig Studio Software.
